Perfect — below is a clean, optimized, copy-paste storyboard template you can reuse forever.
It’s designed specifically for Sora Shorts, character consistency, light education, and high retention.

I’ll give you:

How to use it (important)

A locked HOST ANCHOR

A VARIABLE-BASED STORYBOARD TEMPLATE

Optimization tips (this is where performance comes from)

🎬 HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE (READ ONCE)

You will only change the variables marked like this:
👉 {LOCATION}, {FACT_1}, etc.

Never rewrite the host description.

Use Storyboard mode ON

Keep total length 15–22 seconds

This gives you repeatability + consistency + scale.

🔑 HOST ANCHOR (LOCK THIS — NEVER CHANGE)

Paste this at the very top of every Sora prompt:

The host is the same recurring character in every video: a realistic but slightly stylized young woman in her late 20s, with soft symmetrical facial features, calm expressive eyes, natural makeup, and a warm, approachable presence. She has long dark brown hair worn loose with subtle movement in the wind. Her face shape, proportions, and overall appearance remain consistent across all scenes and episodes. She appears intelligent, grounded, and authentic — not a model, not exaggerated. She wears practical, stylish travel clothing appropriate to the environment.

🧩 STORYBOARD TEMPLATE (OPTIMIZED FOR SHORTS)
🎬 SORA STORYBOARD — REPEATABLE TRAVEL SERIES
🟦 SHOT 1 — ESTABLISHING (2–3s)

Purpose: Instantly communicate where we are and stop the scroll.

Wide cinematic establishing shot of {LOCATION}. The environment is immediately recognizable through natural landmarks and atmosphere. Soft overcast lighting, gentle wind, subtle environmental motion.

🎙 Voiceover (Line 1):

“This is {LOCATION}.”

🟦 SHOT 2 — HOST ENTERS FRAME (3–4s)

Purpose: Reinforce host consistency + human connection.

The recurring female host walks naturally into frame within {LOCATION}, turning slightly toward the camera. Her movement is relaxed and confident. Wind subtly moves her hair and clothing.

🎙 Voiceover (Line 2):

“It’s one of the most unique places on Earth.”

🟦 SHOT 3 — CONTEXT & EDUCATION (4–5s)

Purpose: Deliver value (education) without sounding like a tour guide.

Medium shot of the host near a defining feature of {LOCATION}. Environmental details clearly show what makes this place special. Camera movement is smooth and minimal.

🎙 Voiceover (Line 3):

“What you’re seeing here is {FACT_1}.”

🟦 SHOT 4 — MEANING / IMPACT (3–4s)

Purpose: Emotional hook (why this place matters).

The host pauses and looks out toward the landscape. The environment feels vast and calm. Motion remains subtle and cinematic.

🎙 Voiceover (Line 4):

“It exists because {FACT_2}.”

🟦 SHOT 5 — LOOP SHOT (2–3s)

Purpose: Retention + rewatch.

Wide shot visually similar to Shot 1, allowing a seamless loop. Natural motion continues.

🎙 Voiceover (Line 5):

“Places like this change how you think.”

🎼 AUDIO (GLOBAL — DO NOT CHANGE)

Soft ambient cinematic music throughout, calm and inspirational, minimal instrumentation, slow build, no vocals.

🎥 VISUAL STYLE (GLOBAL — DO NOT CHANGE)

Realistic but slightly stylized visuals to avoid uncanny valley. Natural colors, soft contrast, subtle film grain. No on-camera dialogue, no lip-sync, no text overlays.

🔄 VARIABLES YOU SWAP EACH EPISODE

You ONLY change these:

{LOCATION}

{FACT_1} (what it is / how it formed)

{FACT_2} (why it’s unique / why it matters)

Example (Iceland – Black Sand Beach)

{LOCATION} → “Iceland’s black sand beaches”

{FACT_1} → “volcanic rock shaped by the Atlantic Ocean”

{FACT_2} → “centuries of eruptions meeting constant erosion”

⚙️ OPTIMIZATION TIPS (THIS MATTERS)
✅ Ideal Length

15–22 seconds total

Never exceed 25 seconds

✅ Best Shot Timing

Shot 3 is the longest (education)

Shot 1 + Shot 5 mirror each other (loop)

✅ Best Posting Time

Evening / late night

Calm content performs better then

✅ Avoid These (Very Important)

❌ No dialogue
❌ No fast cuts
❌ No over-explaining
❌ No influencer language
❌ No camera talking-head style

📈 WHY THIS TEMPLATE PERFORMS

Familiar host builds trust

Education gives value

Calm pacing increases watch time

Loop boosts replays

Consistency trains the algorithm

This is exactly how scalable AI travel channels are built.
